# IVF_Center_Profit_Projection

## QUESTION

An IVF Hospital Chain with a nationwide capacity of 1000 patients per month and 100 patients
#per center have been instructed to do annual budget planning. As part of the same, they are 
#analyzing patient footfalls and revenues.

#The chain follows a package pricing system. They makes $1000 profit per baby born, 
#$200 for a twin, $-1000 for a triplet and $-2000 when it is a quadruplet. 
#It makes no profit when there is a miscarriage. 

#The average footfall per month follows an uniform distribution between 72 to 84 per center. 
#Analyzing the data from the past, you found there is a 25% chance of twin, 5% chance for a 
#triplet, 1% chance of a quadruplet and 4% chance of miscarriage. 

#Given the CEO wants a detailed profit projection, can you help the IVF chain?

#---------------------------------------------- LOGIC -------------------------------------------
#1. Total number of center need to be calculated from total capacity and capacity per center.
#2. Need to simulate the total profit for each center.
#3. Need to define all the package and their type along with their profit scheme.
#4. One generalised user defined function can be generated, so that the profit calculation for 
#   each center can be done even if the package, center count or patient count changes.
#5. The profit calculation process can be iterated using a loop for number of times equal to the 
#   number of centers.
#6. The entire process is then iterated for each month throughout the year to get the annual 
#   budget.
#7. In a single dataframe all the total number of patients from each package and total profit 
#   for each center is stored, to give the detailed annual profit projection to the CEO.

#----------------------------------------- DATA CONTAINER ---------------------------------------
#1. One to save the total number of center.
#2. One vector to save the pakage type name.
#3. One vector for storing the profit for each package.
#4. One vector for defining the probability of occurring each package.
#5. One for storing the maximum average patients that can come in a center and one to store the 
#   minimum number of the same.
#6. One to store the average footfall per month generated randomly from an uniform distribution
#   between 72 and 82.
#7. A sample to find the number of babies born to each patient.
#8. Count of patients falling in each package.
#9. One to calculate total profit of each center.

#--------------------------------------------- FUNCTIONS ----------------------------------------
#1. One user defined function to calculate the profit of each center and save the same in a 
#   dataframe. And inside the function a for loop has been used to iterate the process for each 
#   centers month-wise. As argument all the total number of centers, package type, profit for 
#   each package, probability of each package in each center and the maximum and minimum number 
#   of patients has been passed to make the function more generalised. And at last the whole 
#   process is iterated for each 12 month.

#--------------------------------------------- PROCEDURE ----------------------------------------
#1. runif() - To generate a random number from a uniform distribution between 72 and 82.
#2. round() - To round off the random number generated from the runif() function.
#3. sample() - To create a sample of size equal to the number generated from runif().
#4. sum() - To find the sum.
#5. data.frame() - To create a dataframe.
#6. for - To create a for loop.
#7. colSums() - To find the sum of the columns passed as argument of a dataframe.
